# Negative indexing: the last element has the index number -1, the second to last element has the index number -2, and so on.

# Negative indexing is useful when we want to select the last element of a list â€” especially if the list is long, and we can't tell the length by counting.

row_1 = ['Facebook', 0.0, 'USD', 2974676, 3.5]
